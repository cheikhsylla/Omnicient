# Quick start

Hello,

You're expected to complete an exercice on this boilerplate.

## Runtime

We expect you to be able to run this code in node.js at this latest stable version.
If you have trouble installing node.js we expect you to use [node version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro).
We expect this code to run better in linux (ubuntu) / macos / wsl2 (windows) environment..
You can also run it through gitbash if you want to stick to windows only but it's at your own risk.
This  boilerplate allows you to run your code in ES6 with [Vue 3 cli](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/application.html#mounting-the-app).

## Code organization

I expect you to write your production code in "src/App.vue" and it's components.
I will inspect your code by running ``yarn serve``

## Project setup
```
npm run setup
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Test briefing

You can find the test instructions in [TEST-FE.md](./TEST-FE.md)

# Test notation

- I will look at your commits and the way they're structured.
- I will look a your code architecture.
- I will look at how you organized your codebase.
- I will look at your synthax and code style (less).
- Absence of unit test is ok as long as you explain how you tested your code instead.
- I will look at how you organize/manage data and states in your front-end code.
  ->>> Use of pattern(s) is a plus, use a Vuex is a plus if you decide to use Vue.js.

Good Luck !
